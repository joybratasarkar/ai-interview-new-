🧠 How to build your dynamic flow in LangGraph
1. Intro + consent as first states
Node: intro_greet
Bot: “Hello! I’m your AI interviewer—may I begin?”
This is generated dynamically and not hardcoded after the initial turn.

Node: check_consent
Pass user response to LLM:

If “yes” or equivalent → transition to interview.

If “not yet” → stay in consent phase, generate clarifying question or follow-up, waiting until positive intent emerges.

This means consent is treated as a dynamic dialog loop rather than a fixed “yes or no” branch.

2. Dynamic Intent Detection & Routing
Once consent is received:

Node: detect_intent (LLM-powered):
Examine whether candidate’s response pertains to the question or starts open-chat.
If it's off-topic → route to open-chat state. Otherwise, proceed to answer scoring. This dynamic LLM-based routing allows opening chat whenever the user shifts topics.

3. Adaptive Follow‑up Strategy
Your scoring mechanism generates a score and expression and decides whether to ask a follow‑up.

Limiting to max 1 or 2 follow‑ups per question is controlled by state (e.g. followup_asked_count).

If a follow-up is warranted, you invoke ask_followup; otherwise, you move forward — all decided at runtime per candidate response.

4. Smooth Interruption Handling (“Open Chat”)
Node: free_chat handles when the candidate goes off-script.

If chat short (<2 turns): answer their question conversationally.

If chat reaches 2 turns: you intelligently transition back: answer briefly, then smoothly bring them back to the interview question flow, resuming where left off.

That logic is dynamic—you aren’t statically redirecting; you’re conversing and then reintegrating logic based on turn count.

5. Loop and Termination Logic
After each Q or follow-up, check whether more questions remain.

If yes → move to next question node.

If no → generate a natural wrap-up and end.

Because nodes call the LLM to decide when to wrap up (e.g. “Thank you—this concludes our interview”), the language and tone can vary dynamically.

6. Memory & Context-Aware
Use MemorySaver or similar to track:

whether consent is given,

how many follow-ups used,

how many chat turns,

candidate responses/context to personalize follow-ups or transitions.

LangGraph’s memory system lets the flow adapt based on previous interactions.

✅ Summary of Dynamic Flow Structure
Phase	Node	Behavior
Intro / Consent	intro_greet	Ask to begin. Single-turn greeting, dynamic rephrasing on retries.
check_consent	LLM checks consent intent; continues consent dialog until positive.
Main Interview	detect_intent	LLM classifies user input as ANSWER or CHAT dynamically.
score_route	Score surfacing & follow-up decision per answer.
ask_followup	Possibly ask one short additional question.
free_chat	Handle open chat, then transition back adaptively.
advance	Move to next question or end; wrap-up phrasing is generated dynamically.

All transitions are guided by LLM prompts and state variables, making the entire flow responsive to candidate input in real time. write the prompt for this
