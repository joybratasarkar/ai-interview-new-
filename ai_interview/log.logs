[2025-07-28 11:08:16,591: WARNING/ForkPoolWorker-7] Processing interview - User text: 'Here's an example of how a Google SDE2 engineer might describe their experience: I'm currently a Software Development Engineer 2 at Google, where I've been for the past two and a half years. I joined Google after completing my Master's in Computer Science from Stanford, where I specialized in distributed systems and machine learning. Before Google, I spent two years as a software engineer at a mid-size tech startup where I worked primarily on backend services and API development. That experience taught me a lot about building scalable systems from the ground up and working in a fast-paced environment with limited resources. At Google, I'm part of the Cloud Storage team where I focus on optimizing data replication algorithms and improving system reliability. I've led the development of a new caching layer that reduced latency by 30% for our most frequently accessed data. I primarily work with Go, C++, and Python, and I'm deeply involved in our monitoring and observability infrastructure. One of my most significant contributions was architecting a solution for cross-region data consistency that's now used across multiple Google Cloud services. I also mentor junior engineers and have been involved in our hiring process, conducting technical interviews. I'm passionate about large-scale distributed systems and have published two papers on consensus algorithms. Outside of work, I contribute to open-source projects and enjoy participating in competitive programming contests.', Question index: 0, Phase: questions
