        "We used a hybrid approach - collaborative filtering with matrix factorization for the core recommendations, and then a real-time layer using Redis for caching and feature serving. The tricky part was dealing with the cold start problem for new users and products.",
        
        "The cold start was interesting - for new users, we built a quick onboarding flow that captured their preferences through a few questions and then used content-based filtering initially. For new products, we used product metadata and category-based recommendations until we had enough interaction data.",
        
        "The results were really good! We improved click-through rates by 23% and conversion rates by 15%. But more importantly, we reduced the average response time from 300ms to 80ms, which significantly improved the user experience."
